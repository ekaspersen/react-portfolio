                    Hello there! My name is Eskil K. Hagen and i am a Frontend
                    Developer and User Interface Designer. This means i am
                    capable of getting a website up and running for a client by
                    myself from the brief to the website is done. But altough i
                    can, i love having some company when i am designing or
                    developing.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium">
                    In my work, I strive to create interfaces that are
                    user-friendly and visually pleasing, always seeking to
                    understand the end-users needs and expectations. My academic
                    background has given me a solid foundation in coding
                    standards and UX principles. I'm always eager to continue
                    improving, i learn something new every day!
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium">
                    Collaborating with team members is one of the aspects I
                    enjoy most about what I do. I've found that I can often help
                    to keep the team spirit high with my outgoing personality,
                    and I believe that a happy, motivated team is key to good
                    workflow.
                </p>
                <p className="font-medium">
                    Away from my professional life, I value the time spent with
                    friends and engaging in various activities. These
                    experiences help me maintain a balanced lifestyle, providing
                    me with fresh perspectives that I believe also benefit my
                    work.
                </p>
